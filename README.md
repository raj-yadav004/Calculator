# Calculator



## 📝 Description

This project is a basic calculator application. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface for inputting numbers and selecting operations, making it easy to use for everyone. It is built without a specific tech stack mentioned, implying it may use basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a web-based version or a simple language like Python for a command-line interface. Its key features include number input, operation selection (+, -, *, /), display of results, and error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
